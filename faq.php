                     <div>
                        <pre> <p align="justify">

  Ans.: When by demolishing old building, new building is constructed at that place, means re-development of the old building, then the developer gives various benefits as follow :-

  1. To give additional area than previous area.
  2. No amenities like lift, garden, parking place.
  3. To provide temporary home or to give its rent during the period of construction.
  4. To give consideration for shifting residence or brokerage for searching new residence.

  Even after giving these benefits, when new building is completed and after shifting to the new flat and since the Municipal Corporation takes the property tax at new rate it cause increase in property tax in 3 to 4 fold. To help for paying this increased property tax, the developer gives a lump sum amount to each member. Its called Corpus Fund. Some developer gives this corpus fund in the name of the society or some times directly gives in the name of members. Developer gives this fund in different steps. In fact, it is necessary that at least 50% of the fund should be given at the time of agreement by the developer and the balance 50% amount should have to be given after getting permission for construction or before vacating the house.

  If some developer giving corpus fund at the time of making available of the new flat then by not obeying this condition it is necessary to take the amount of the fund before vacating the old home. Some developers left after their saleable flats sold out or the get their money without giving corpus fund amount decided earlier.

  At the end huge legal action has to be taken for recovering that amount. To avoid this, corpus fund should be taken earlier is better.

  It is also discuss many a time that how this corpus fund is distributed among the members? Some members, even if there area of flat is less, demanded for equal distribution of this corpus fund among the members. The reason behind this is that since this benefit is of the society, it is necessary to distribute that fund to each member equally.

  While purchasing flat, the amount of the land is also charge on the flat owner with the amount of flat purchase and he is paying that total amount. If some member purchase flat of more area then he also paid more amount of the land in that proportion. Second point is that, T.D.R. is available equal to the re-development will depend upon the availability of TDR to us. Therefore to distribute corpus fund as per each flat owner’s area is necessary. However, it is proper to take decision in majority in this regard in the General Body Meeting.

                        <pre> <p align="justify">
  Ans.: Subside land of the society is very serious matter and it may cause danger to the society and possibility of collapsing building also. It is utmost necessary on the part of the society to get inspected the building from the Structural Engineer immediately and to get report regarding reasons behind the land subside and if there is a danger to the Original Structure of the building. Similarly to get instructions from then in respect of building is not danger for residence and which necessary repairs adopted for stopping land subside.

                     <div>
                        <pre> <p align="justify">

  Ans.: It is the responsibility of flat owner to pay all dues of the society once the possession of the flat is taken whether it is in use or close for some period. There is no provision or rule in the bye-laws or Act that if a flat is close then not to charge any charges on that flat or give some concession in it. It is not proper to say that since the flat is close or flat owner, his family members or friends utilizing the flat for very less time and therefore to issue bill. Because to take note of who, when and how much time someone utilized his flat is arduous and complicated work. If in some societies a flat is close for some stipulated time and society is not charging water bill or general body pass resolution in that respect then it may be an exceptional case. Certainly, if personal fittings and supply of water measured by personal meter than only it will be possible for not charging water bill or give concession in it.

  4. After selection of a builder and before having talk to him, the enquiry should be made about what is the price of our land and similarly if new construction take place what will be its price.
  5. The plan, layout, designs prepared by the developer should be shown to your consultant.
  6. What are your society’s expectation from builder should be already determined.
  7. If members of the society agree with the plan, layout designs shown by the developer then they should appoint their separate advocate and executed agreement with the Developer. Signatures should not be made on any paper without the consent of the advocate.
  8. Which amenities builder is going to provide to the members should be explicitly mentioned in the agreement. Thereby confusion of any type and cheating will not happened.
  9. Explanation should be made in agreement about how the developer will make temporary accommodation agreement for the members and how much rent and in what form he will going to pay.
  10. Consent of the each member of the society for the re-development work should be taken in writing. Take detail information of each flat otherwise there may cause difficulties if any flat in the society is mortgage or any type of loan liability on it.
  11. The date of completing the project should be decided first.
  12. The information about how much monthly maintenance amount and similarly taxes amount to be incurred should be get from your C.A.

  14. How much area of carpet, built up and also open space, parking space after re-development should be mentioned in it.
  15. If there is a balcony in the flat, then details of it that whether it is big or small.
  16. If any member want big are then there should be explicit information about how much more amount he has to pay.
  17. While appointing Developer, bank guarantee should be taken without fail so that if developer fail to return money then the bank will return our money.
  18. If we check all these matters, then there would be no any problem in the re-development of our society and the dream of our new home which we saw will be complete.

                     <div>
                        <pre> <p align="justify">

  Ans.: In fact the responsibility to repair the leakages due to rainy water is of the management of the society. Because this leakage may cause danger to the structure of the building due to construction of bim, column. However where there are private terrace the security of the building is forgotten in the dispute that whether the repairing work to be carried out by the flat owner (who is the owner of the terrace) or by the society.

  Therefore the flat owner residing below the terrace would have to suffer and also bear loss. If complaint regarding water leakage received the management of the society immediately call. Faults repairing report after getting inspection from the Engineer and accordingly compel the concerned flat owner for doing proper repairing and if he is not co-operate then by carried out repairing themselves, recovery of the entire amount should be made from the flat owner. Provision regarding this has been made in the bye-law No. 48. Similarly detailed elucidation regarding repairs has been made in bye-law No. 160. Of repairing of the terrace is successful only if it is made under the supervision of Engineer and from expert workers and by using good quality waterproof material. Of course it is expensive also. Therefore charges were taken monthly and regularly from the flat owner having private terrace to meet the expenses of building maintenance and repairing at the rate mentioned in bye-law No. 69(3). Similarly amount is also collected for major repairs. For both of these the area is calculated as 1/3 of the total area of the terrace. If the management of the society shows apathy for repairing work than making complaint to the Municipal Corporation and by following it then the Municipal Corporation by taking action on the management of the society and against the concerned private contractor compel them to carryout repairing work.
